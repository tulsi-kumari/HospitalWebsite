### Phase 2: Learning the Basics of Relevant Technologies
- This phase involved acquiring foundational knowledge of the technologies used, including React.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB.

### Phase 3: Backend Setup
- We set up the backend infrastructure, laying the foundation for user authentication and data management.

### Phase 4: API Gateways for User Sign-Up
- We developed API endpoints to facilitate user registration, allowing users to sign up for the platform.

### Phase 5: Testing Sign-Up APIs Using POSTMAN
- Extensive testing using POSTMAN ensured the robustness and reliability of the user registration process.

### Phase 6: API Gateways for User Sign-In
- We created API gateways for users to log in to the platform securely.

### Phase 7: Encryption of Passwords Using bcrypt.js
- Passwords were securely encrypted using bcrypt.js to enhance user data protection.

### Phase 8: User Authentication Using Tokens
- Token-based authentication was implemented to manage user access and privileges effectively.

### Phase 9: Changing the Layout
- The website's layout underwent enhancements to improve user experience and aesthetics.

### Phase 10: Managing Form State Using useState Hook
- We utilized the useState hook to manage form state, ensuring seamless interaction for users.

### Phase 11: Making Access Denied and Error Pages
- Custom access denied and error pages were created to handle exceptional scenarios gracefully.

### Phase 12: Connecting Backend to Frontend Using Fetch API
- We established a connection between the backend and frontend using the Fetch API for seamless data exchange.

### Phase 13: Creating All Different Pages
- All necessary pages, such as user profiles, appointment scheduling, and more, were developed to provide a comprehensive user experience.

### Phase 14: Form Validation
- Form validation was implemented to ensure data accuracy and user-friendly interactions.

### Phase 15: Other Minor Changes
